# Proposed Project

## Name of Game
Minesweeper

## Brief Description
Randomly generate a rectangular board with selected number of "mines" for each game.

## Game Rules
1. Clear the unit of the board without detonating the "mines".
2. Player can only input one position (in row and column) to be cleared for each movement.
3. For each movement, if the selected unit is not "mine", there will be hints provided, telling the player how many "mines" around the cleared area.
4. If all the unit are cleared and the "mines" are not detonated, the game will finish and the player will win the game.
